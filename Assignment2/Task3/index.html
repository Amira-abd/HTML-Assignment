     <!-- Task 3: Format a Recipe -->
     <!--Create a recipe page with a title, ingredients (use formatting for measurements), instructions with line breaks,
      and use hr to separate sections. Style some text with span elements.-->
    <h1>recipe</h1>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <h3>water</h3>
        <h3>sugar</h3>
        <h3>orange</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>The "Roll" (Pro Tip): Before cutting, roll the oranges firmly against the counter with
             the palm of your hand. This breaks the internal membranes and makes them release more juice.</li><br>
        <li>The Prep: Slice the oranges in half crosswise (across the "equator").</li><br>
        <li>The Squeeze: Use your juicer to extract the liquid. If you’re doing it by hand, use a fork to twist inside the fruit while squeezing to get every last drop.</li><br>
        <li>The Strain:Pour straight into a glass.</li><br>
        <li>The Chill: Serve over ice immediately, or refrigerate for up to 24 hours.</li>
    </ol>
